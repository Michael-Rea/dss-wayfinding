# SVG Format

## Introduction
The maps themselves are stored in SVG format, including both display graphs
and the non-visual data structure representing available paths.

This document aims to cover the format as required by the current Wayfinding
source code. It is important that any application which modifies or exports
SVGs conform to this format. Popular applications such as Adobe Illustrator
are known to have very specific export options required to format the SVGs
correctly.

## The Overall Structure
SVG files themselves are formatted as XML, allowing a map file to be opened
and modified in plain text editors. Important elements to understand include
the tags <g> (group), <a> (anchor link, also known simply as a link),
<polygon> (representing an arbitrary polygon), and <line> (representing a
line).

Wayfinding uses the <g> (group) tags to organize the map into several
important layers:

 - Rooms
 - Portals
 - Doors
 - Paths
 
### Rooms
A room is a human-addressable location such as "1138", "0120", or "5201".
Room numbers typically start with a digit representing their floor number
(0 for a basement), followed by a floor-specific address. In order to
route to a room, it must have a door. Should your building have rooms
without doors, it's best not to question it.

### Portals
A portal connects one map file to another. It is important to parse portals
in order to build a complete graph. Portals have an ID which uniquely
identifies a stairwell or elevator and indicates its connecting terminal.

For example, in public/maps/floor0.svg you'll find a Portal labeled
"Stair.1.floor1". If you then open public/maps/floor1.svg, you'll find
its matching "Stair.1.floor0". Note that stairwells often lead to multiple
floors so a single floor map may have multiple portals in the same location
which lead to different floors, e.g. floor0.svg could have portals
"Stair.1.floor1", "Stair.1.floor2", "Stair.1.floor3", and so on.

### Doors
Doors are the start- and end-points of paths.

### Paths
Paths are the connections between doors. They form the graph to be traversed.
Note that paths may be formed by multiple line segments between doors or
portals.

## Miscellaneous Concerns

### SVG Dimensions and Viewbox
As per the SVG specification, the head <svg> tag may include dimensional
definitions in the form of 'x', 'y', 'width', and 'height'. It may also
have a viewbox which defines the default view onto the SVG data itself,
defined like viewBox="x y w h". While the viewBox may match the exact
dimensions of the SVG, it does not have to. This is useful for rendering
the SVG in a browser where the browser may place its _own_ constraints
on the size of an SVG element.

For example, a SVG document may have the dimensions of (0,0) with a width
and height of 100. The viewBox may then specify the default view to be
(0, 0) to (50, 50) in order to show only the upper-left quadrant.
